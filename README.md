# Elevator Simulation

A browser-based simulation of a simple elevator system with request handling, direction control, and floor-by-floor movement. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project simulates the operation of an elevator in a building with 10 floors (0 to 9). Users can:

- **Request** the elevator from any floor.
- **Enter a destination floor** once picked up.
- **Observe elevator behavior** as it handles multiple pickup and drop-off requests efficiently.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate fundamental logic and control flow in a real-time system using frontend web technologies.

## Features

- âœ… Dynamic floor request buttons.
- âœ… Elevator direction logic (up/down).
- âœ… Simulated travel and wait time delays.
- âœ… Floor highlighting during stops.
- âœ… Request queue management for both pickups and drop-offs.
- âœ… Real-time count of pending drop-off requests.

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** â€“ Markup for structuring the simulation interface.
- **CSS3** â€“ Styling the interface elements and layout.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** â€“ Elevator logic, event handling, and dynamic UI updates.

## How It Works

1. **Click** any floor's request button to call the elevator.
2. When the elevator reaches your floor:
   - It will **prompt you** to enter your destination floor.
   - The request button will reset.
3. The elevator processes drop-off requests in sequence based on direction logic.
4. The simulation stops when all pending requests are served.

## UI

> ðŸ”´ Floor the elevator is currently on  
> ðŸ”µ Button pressed requesting the elevator  
> âšª Idle or served request button  

*Red dot on floor indicates current elevator position.*
